## Motivations & Covered Topics

This is the last project of the `Udacity-Full-Stack-Nanodegree` Course.
It covers following technical topics in 1 app:

1. Database modeling with `postgres` & `sqlalchemy` (see `models.py`)
2. API to performance CRUD Operations on database with `Flask` (see `app.py`)
3. Automated testing with `Unittest` (see `test_app`)
4. Authorization & Role based Authentification with `Auth0` (see `auth.py`)
5. Deployment on `AWS`

<a name="start-locally"></a>
## Start Project locally

Make sure you `cd` into the correct folder (with all app files) before following the setup steps.
Also, you need the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine.

To start and run the local development server.

<ul>
<li> Initialize and activate a virtualenv: </li>

```bash
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env_capstone
$ source env_capstone/scripts/activate
```

<li> Install the dependencies: </li>

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<li> Setup Auth0 </li>
If you only want to test the API (i.e. Project Reviewer), you can
simply take the existing bearer tokens in `config.py` and `capstone.conf`.

If you already know your way around `Auth0`, just insert your data 
into `config.py` => auth0_config.

FYI: Here are the steps I followed to enable [authentification](#authentification).

<li> Run the development server: </li>

```bash 
$ python app.py
```

<li> (optional) To execute tests, run </li>

```bash 
$ python test_app.py
```
If you choose to run all tests, it should give this response if everything went fine:

```bash
$ python test_app.py
.............................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 29 tests in 15.906s

OK

```
</ul>

## API Documentation

Here you can find all existing endpoints, which methods can be used, how to work with them & example responses youÂ´ll get.

Additionally, common pitfalls & error messages are explained, if applicable.

### Base URL

**http://ec2-3-128-91-119.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/**

### Authentification

Please see [API Authentification](#authentification-bearer)

### Available Endpoints

Here is a short table about which ressources exist and which method you can use on them.

# <a name="authentification"></a>
## Authentification

All API Endpoints are decorated with Auth0 permissions. To use the project locally, you need to config Auth0 accordingly

### Auth0 for locally use
#### Create an App & API

1. Login to https://manage.auth0.com/ 
2. Click on Applications Tab
3. Create Application
4. Give it a name like `Music` and select "Regular Web Application"
5. Go to Settings and find `domain`. Copy & paste it into config.py => auth0_config['AUTH0_DOMAIN'] (i.e. replace `"example-matthew.eu.auth0.com"`)
6. Click on API Tab 
7. Create a new API:
   1. Name: `Music`
   2. Identifier `Music`
   3. Keep Algorithm as it is
8. Go to Settings and find `Identifier`. Copy & paste it into config.py => auth0_config['API_AUDIENCE'] (i.e. replace `"Example"`)

#### Create Roles & Permissions

1. Before creating `Roles & Permissions`, you need to `Enable RBAC` in your API (API => Click on your API Name => Settings = Enable RBAC => Save)
2. Also, check the button `Add Permissions in the Access Token`.
2. First, create a new Role under `Users and Roles` => `Roles` => `Create Roles`
3. Give it a descriptive name like `Casting Assistant`.
4. Go back to the API Tab and find your newly created API. Click on Permissions.
5. Create & assign all needed permissions accordingly 
6. After you created all permissions this app needs, go back to `Users and Roles` => `Roles` and select the role you recently created.
6. Under `Permissions`, assign all permissions you want this role to have. 

# <a name="authentification-bearer"></a>
### Auth0 to use existing API
If you want to access the real, temporary API, bearer tokens for all 3 roles are included in the `config.py` file.

## Existing Roles

They are 3 Roles with distinct permission sets:

1. Casting Assistant:
  - GET /actors (view:actors): Can see all actors
  - GET /movies (view:movies): Can see all movies
2. Casting Director (everything from Casting Assistant plus)
  - POST /actors (create:actors): Can create new Actors
  - PATCH /actors (edit:actors): Can edit existing Actors
  - DELETE /actors (delete:actors): Can remove existing Actors from database
  - PATCH /movies (edit:movies): Can edit existing Movies
3. Exectutive Producer (everything from Casting Director plus)
  - POST /movies (create:movies): Can create new Movies
  - DELETE /movies (delete:movies): Can remove existing Motives from database

In your API Calls, add them as Header, with `Authorization` as key and the `Bearer token` as value. DonÂ´t forget to also
prepend `Bearer` to the token (seperated by space).

For example: (Bearer token for `Executive Director`)
```js
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_token"
}
```
